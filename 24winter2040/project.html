<h2>Research Project</h2>

The goal of this project is explore an application of linear algebra not covered in class.
This is your opportunity to see how the concepts we've learned can be applied in real-world scenarios, and in particular in your areas of interest.

<h3>Choosing your project</h3>

You should choose a topic that goes beyond the contents of the lectures.
This can be for instance an application of the theory or a theorem not covered in class.

<p>The project is supposed to be be <b>an instructive piece of content</b> for the topic you have chosen.
<b>You are free to choose the media format for your project</b>, but please keep it to a reasonable size.
Here are some examples:
<ul>
  <li>Alice decides to implement the PageRank algorithm in Python.
      She submits her code and a written note explaining the related eigenvalue problem.</li>
  <li>Berry wants to explain why quantum computers processing power scales exponentially on the number of qubits. 
      They record a short video explaining how this follows from the dimension formula for tensor products.</li>
  <li>Clyde is curious about the Jordan normal form.
      He writes an 11 page paper explaining that theorem.</li>
  <li>Dorothy heard about Fourier transforms in her differential equations class.
      She decides to draw a comic explaining how Fourier transforms find the components of a function in a particular basis</li>
  <li>Esha likes to use Chat GPT for er learning.
      She writes a 9 page paper explaining the attention mechanism underlying large language models.</li>
  <li>Farhad digs up a game they created and which used lots of vectors.
      He records a video explaining that.</li>
</ul>

You are absolutely welcome to come up with a creative topic and media format for your project.

<h3>Submitting your project</h3>

Once you have found a topic that interests you, email your instructor with a short project proposal with a rought topic description and and project outline.
<b>Proposals must be handed by the midterm exam.</b>
Group sizes are 1 to 3 people.

<p>
<b>The project is due on the final day of classes</b>, by email to your instructor, but they can be turned in anytime throughout the semester.
Students who submit early will received targeted feedback and have the chance to resubmit to improve their grade.

<h3>Assessment</h3>

<p>The grading will follow the <a href="EMRN">EMRN rubric</a>. (E = 100%, M = 80%, R = 50%, N = 0%)
Projects submitted before the deadline may be reviewed for a grade increase.</p>
