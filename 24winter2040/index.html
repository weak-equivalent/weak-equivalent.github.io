<h3>Course Description</h3>

<p>MATH 2040 is designed to provide foundations of linear algebra required for mathematics, physics, computer science, and other fields of application.
We will cover the basic theory of vector spaces, including the study of eigenvectors and inner product spaces. 
<br><i>Prerequisites:</i> MATH 1030, and MATH 1000 <i>or</i> MATH 1215.</p>


<h3>Course materials</h3>
<p>
The textbook for the class is Linear Algebra Done Right, fourth edition, by Sheldon Axler.
This book is available from the Dalhousie Bookstore and from <a href="https://linear.axler.net/">the author's webpage</a>.
The author has also recorded <a href="https://linear.axler.net/LADRvideos4e.html">videos</a> summarizing sections of the book.
</p>

<p>Further resources recommendations will be available on the <a href="content.html#top">Course Content</a> page at the course website.</p>


<h3>Course Assessment</h3>

<ul>
<li>Participation (5%): participation in class, office hours, or discussion forums.</li>
<li>Homework (15%): assigned weekly through WebWork.</li>
<li>Midterm 1 (20%): in class on <b>February 11</b>.</li>
<li>Midterm 2 (20%): in class on <b>March 18</b>.</li>
<li>Final Exam(40%): April 16 3:30pm.
</ul>


<h3>Course Policies</h3>

<ol>
<li>
You can get help for this course at the Mathematics Learning Centre.
It is located in Chase 119 and will be operating in-person and remotely.
Tutors are available Monday through Friday from 11:30am - 4:30pm (in-person) and from 6:30- 7:30pm (remotely) on a first come, first served basis, free of
charge.
Register for the Brightspace "course" at <a href="https://www.dal.ca/faculty/science/math-stats/about/learning-centre.html">dal.ca/faculty/science/math-stats/about/learning-centre.html</a> to access the online support and see the latest schedule.
The Learning Centre also has large tables where you can work together.
</li><li>
You are allowed to a prepared handwritten A4 study sheet with you to your midterm tests and to the final exam..
</li><li>
The midterm tests will be <a href="https://cwsei.ubc.ca/files/resources/instructor/Two-stage_Exams.pdf">two-stage exams</a>.
Students will first complete and turn in an individual exam and then, working in small groups, will complete the same exam again working in small groups.
</li><li>
In the event that you are unable to attend the midterm or final exam due to exceptional circumstances, please notify your instructor via email in advance to determine what alternatives may be possible.
</li><li>
Homework will be assigned weekly through WebWork on Brightspace.
Your lowest homework score will be automatically dropped.
</li><li>
Late homework will not be accepted except with the instructor's prior permission.
If you need a short extension and contact the instructor ahead of time, one will always be given.
When a request is made ahead of time, you do not need to submit a Student Declaration of Absence.
</li><li>
There is an opportunity to highlight applications of linear algebra to your field of interest in this class.
By writing a short note on an applications of linear algebra, you can drop two low homework grades (for a total of 3 drops).
You are welcome to use an AI chatbot to help you figure out an application, but your submission must use your own words.
</li><li>
Students are encouraged to work in groups - <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/45/eaba9221">studies have shown that social ties are a main predictor of success in STEM classes.</a>
Still, each student must complete their own individual homework and exams.
</li><li>
Problem sets will be posted following roughly each chapter covered in the book.
These will not be graded, but I strongly encourage you to work on them: while homework questions are designed as routine exercises to aid in your learning, problem sets challenge you with harder questions, and some of the problems might be in the exams.
You can submit problems for feedback by your instructor in paper, via email, or during office hours.
</li><li>
5% per cent of your grade is for participation.
There are at least four ways to participate: asking or answering questions in class, coming to office hours, asking questions on the course Brightspace forum, and submitting problem sets for feedback.
Each time you do so, you gain 1 participation point, and 5 points equals 5%.
I reserve the right to not award points in case of frivolous activity, such as asking if 1+1=2 - the point is participation.
