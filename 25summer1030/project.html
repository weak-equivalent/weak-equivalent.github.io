</ul>


<h3>Course Policies</h3>

<ol>
<li>
If you are having trouble with material in the course, please join mine or Dario's <b>office hours</b> Please also use <b>Brightspace discussion board</b>.
Moreover, get registered for Math \textbf{Learning Centre} at <a href="https://tinyurl.com/b8xcx9nmcharge">https://tinyurl.com/b8xcx9nmcharge</a>..
You can also <b>email</b>me to discuss your difficulties, whatever they are. You should do so before it is late; we are here to help!
</li><li>
You are allowed to a prepared <i>handwritten</i> study sheet with you to your final exam.
Calculators are not allowed, nor needed - answers may be left unsimplified.
</li><li>
Homework will be assigned weekly through WebWork on Brightspace.
Late homework will not be accepted , but your lowest homework score will be automatically dropped.
</li><li>
There will be no make-up examination for the midterm. If you be unable to submit the midterm examination, your midterm’s weight will be automatically transferred
to your final exam score. I strongly recommend against this option unless it is your only one.
</li><li>
you are not be able to be physically on campus for the Final Exam on June 20, 2025, there is a make-up exam scheduled for August 25, 2025, 12:30pm-3:30pm (location TBD). If possible, I highly encourage you to plan to make the main exam sitting in June, so as to have a back-up in case there is any need.
</li><li>
Students are encouraged to work together over the course of their studies, including the homework assignments.
<a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/45/eaba9221">Studies have shown that social ties are a main predictor of success in STEM classes.</a>
Still, No collaboration is permitted on the midterm nor the final exam.
</li><li>
2% per cent of your grade is for participation.
There are at least four ways to participate: asking or answering questions in class, coming to office hours, asking and answering questions on the course Brightspace forum.
Each time you do so, you gain 1 participation point, and 2 points equals 2%.
</li><li>
There is an opportunity to highlight applications of linear algebra to your field of interest in this class.
By writing a short note on an applications of linear algebra, you can get up to 3% extra marks.
You are welcome to use an AI chatbot to help you figure out an application, but your submission must use your own words.

Sets will tipically open on Saturday, end of day, and be due on the Monday of the following week, end of day. (e.g. HW2 opens on May 10 and is due on May 19)

<li>
<b>Midterm:</b>
the test will open on Brightspace on May 29 and be due on May 30.
I encourage you to simulate an exam environment on this test, as means to train you for the final exam.
In any case, this is an individual assignment: blatant plagiarism will not be tolerated.

<li>
<b>Final exam:</b>
this test will be held in person on June 20, 12-3:00pm Tupper Theatre B.

Some ways to participate are by asking or answering questions in class, coming to office hours, asking and answering questions on the course Brightspace forum, and sending emails to your instructor.


<li>
<b>Applications of linear algebra:</b>
Many of concepts and theorems that we will see in this course are important to various applied science fields.
Here we take the opportunity to highlight such applications by writing a prompt on a topic that interests you.

Periodically, submissions will be posted for other students to learn about such applications. 
You can ask your instructor for topic suggestions.


<h2>University Policies and Statements</h2>

<h3>This course is governed by the academic rules and regulations set forth in the University Calendar and by Senate.</h3>

<h3>Digital communication</h3>

<p>As per the University code, email is an authorized means of communication for academic and administrative purposes within Dalhousie. The University will assign all students an official email address. This address will remain in effect while the student remains a student and for one academic term following a student's last registration. This is the only email address that will be used for communication with students regarding all academic and administrative matters. Any redirection of email will be at the student's own risk. Each student is expected to check her or his official email address frequently in order to stay current with Dalhousie communications.</p>


<h3>Academic Integrity</h3>

<p>At Dalhousie University, we are guided in all of our work by the values of academic integrity: honesty, trust, fairness, responsibility and respect (The Center for Academic Integrity, Duke University, 1999). As a student, you are required to demonstrate these values in all of the work you do. The University provides policies and procedures that every member of the university community is required to follow to ensure academic integrity.

<h3>Accessibility</h3> 	

<p>
The Advising and Access Services Centre is Dalhousie's centre of expertise for student accessibility and accommodation. The advising team works with students who request accommodation as a result of a disability, religious obligation, or any barrier related to any other characteristic protected under Human Rights legislation (Canada and Nova Scotia).

</p>

<h3>Student Code of Conduct</h3>

<p>Everyone at Dalhousie is expected to treat others with dignity and respect. The Code of Student Conduct allows Dalhousie to take disciplinary action if students don't follow this community expectation. When appropriate, violations of the code can be resolved in a reasonable and informal manner-perhaps through a restorative justice process. If an informal resolution can't be reached, or would be inappropriate, procedures exist for formal dispute resolution.
Code: <a href="https://www.dal.ca/dept/university_secretariat/policies/student-life/code-of-student-conduct.html">https://www.dal.ca/dept/university_secretariat/policies/student-life/code-of-student-conduct.html</a></p>

<h3>Diversity and Inclusion - Culture of Respect</h3>

<p>Every person at Dalhousie has a right to be respected and safe. We believe inclusiveness is fundamental to education. We stand for equality. Dalhousie is strengthened in our diversity. We are a respectful and inclusive community. We are committed to being a place where everyone feels welcome and supported, which is why our Strategic Direction prioritizes fostering a culture of diversity and inclusiveness.
