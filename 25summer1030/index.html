<i>Dalhousie University is in Mi'kmaq territory.</i>

<h3>Course Description</h3>

<p>This course is a self-contained introduction to Matrix Theory and Linear Algebra. Topics include: systems of linear equations, vectors in R^n, matrices, spans, linear independence, bases, dimension, linear transformations in R^n, determinants, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, diagonalization, applications.
<br><i>Prerequisites:</i>Nova Scotia Advanced Mathematics 11 or 12 (or equivalent).</p>


<h3>Course materials</h3>
<p>
The textbook for the class is Matrix Theory and Linear Algebra, by Peter Seliger.
This book is available from the Dalhousie Bookstore and from <a href="https://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/linear-algebra/">the author's webpage</a>.
</p>

<p>Further resources recommendations will be available on the <a href="content.html#top">Course Content</a> page at the course website.</p>


<h3>Course Assessment</h3>

<ul>
<li>Homework (30%): assigned weekly through WebWork.</li>
<li>Midterm (10%): assigned via Brightspace on May 29.</li>
<li>Final Exam(60%): June 20, 12-3:00pm Tupper Theatre B.
<li>Participation (2% bonus): participation in class, office hours, or discussion forums..</li>
<li>Project (3% bonus): submitted via Brightspace.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Course Policies</h3>

<ol>
<li>
If you are having trouble with material in the course, please join mine or Dario's <b>office hours</b> Please also use <b>Brightspace discussion board</b>.
Moreover, get registered for Math \textbf{Learning Centre} at <a href="https://tinyurl.com/b8xcx9nmcharge">https://tinyurl.com/b8xcx9nmcharge</a>..
You can also <b>email</b>me to discuss your difficulties, whatever they are. You should do so before it is late; we are here to help!
</li><li>
You are allowed to a prepared <i>handwritten</i> study sheet with you to your final exam.
Calculators are not allowed, nor needed - answers may be left unsimplified.
</li><li>
Homework will be assigned weekly through WebWork on Brightspace.
Late homework will not be accepted , but your lowest homework score will be automatically dropped.
</li><li>
There will be no make-up examination for the midterm. If you be unable to submit the midterm examination, your midterm’s weight will be automatically transferred
to your final exam score. I strongly recommend against this option unless it is your only one.
</li><li>
you are not be able to be physically on campus for the Final Exam on June 20, 2025, there is a make-up exam scheduled for August 25, 2025, 12:30pm-3:30pm (location TBD). If possible, I highly encourage you to plan to make the main exam sitting in June, so as to have a back-up in case there is any need.
</li><li>
Students are encouraged to work together over the course of their studies, including the homework assignments.
<a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/45/eaba9221">Studies have shown that social ties are a main predictor of success in STEM classes.</a>
Still, No collaboration is permitted on the midterm nor the final exam.
</li><li>
2% per cent of your grade is for participation.
There are at least four ways to participate: asking or answering questions in class, coming to office hours, asking and answering questions on the course Brightspace forum.
Each time you do so, you gain 1 participation point, and 2 points equals 2%.
</li><li>
There is an opportunity to highlight applications of linear algebra to your field of interest in this class.
By writing a short note on an applications of linear algebra, you can get up to 3% extra marks.
You are welcome to use an AI chatbot to help you figure out an application, but your submission must use your own words.
