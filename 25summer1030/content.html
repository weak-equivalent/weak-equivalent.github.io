<h3>Assessment</h3>

<p> Midterm test: <a href="1030_midterm">exam</a></p>

<ol>
<li>
<b>Homework:</b> assigned weekly through WebWork via Brightspace.
Sets will tipically open on Saturday, end of day, and be due on the Monday of the following week, end of day. (e.g. HW2 opens on May 10 and is due on May 19)

<li>
<b>Midterm:</b>
the test will open on Brightspace on May 29 and be due on May 30.
I encourage you to simulate an exam environment on this test, as means to train you for the final exam.
In any case, this is an individual assignment: blatant plagiarism will not be tolerated.


<li>
<b>Final exam:</b>
this test will be held in person on June 20, 12-3:00pm Tupper Theatre B.
If you do the homework assignments, you should be prepared for the final.
A practice exam will also be posted.


<li>Participation:
the points is to get you started in engaging with the class, both during and off class time.
Some ways to participate are by asking or answering questions in class, coming to office hours, asking and answering questions on the course Brightspace forum, and sending emails to your instructor.


<li>
<b>Applications of linear algebra:</b>
Many of concepts and theorems that we will see in this course are important to various applied science fields.
Here we take the opportunity to highlight such applications by writing a prompt on a topic that interests you.

You can send your submission to <a href="mailto:daniel.teixeira@dal.ca">daniel.teixeira@dal.ca</a>, or submit it through Brightspace.
Periodically, submissions will be posted for other students to learn about such applications. 
You can ask your instructor for topic suggestions.
